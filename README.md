## Introduction

Electric bicycles, or E-bikes, have gained popularity as an eco-friendly and efficient mode of transportation. This dataset aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data related to E-bikes, including usage patterns, technical specifications, and more. Whether you're interested in analyzing urban mobility trends or exploring the benefits of E-bike adoption, this dataset can serve as a valuable resource.

## Dataset

The dataset is organized into the following categories:

- **Usage Data**: Information about E-bike rides, including distance, duration, starting/ending locations, and timestamps.
- **Technical Specifications**: Details about the E-bike models, including battery capacity, motor power, weight, and dimensions.
- **User Demographics**: Aggregated demographic data about E-bike users, such as age, gender, and location.

The dataset is available in various formats, including CSV and JSON. Please refer to the [data](data/) directory for the complete dataset files.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#### Load the usage data
usage_data = pd.read_csv('data/usage_data.csv')

#### Visualize ride duration distribution
plt.hist(usage_data['duration_minutes'], bins=20, edgecolor='k')
plt.xlabel('Ride Duration (minutes)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('E-Bike Ride Duration Distribution')
plt.show()
